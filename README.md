# VortexAutomation
Small py script to automate the process of downloading mod Collections from Nexus Mods through the Vortex Mod Manager.

## Dependencies
A requirements file is included. The best way to automate the web-browser part of the download is with user scripts. 
You will need to download a user script manager as well as the user script itself 
I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php) as a manager, and the script can be found [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/452309-auto-slow-download-nexus-mods)
